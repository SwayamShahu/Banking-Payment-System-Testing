#  Banking System â€“ Test Scenarios & Test Case Design  

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on designing and documenting **test scenarios** and **test cases** for a **Banking System** to ensure reliable, accurate, and secure operations.  
Core modules such as **Login**, **Fund Transfer**, **Transaction History**, **Account Creation**, and **Logout** were manually tested under valid and invalid conditions to verify system behavior, data validation, and error handling.

## Objectives  
- Identify and define key **test scenarios** for core banking features.  
- Create detailed **test cases** covering positive and negative conditions.  
- Validate data input, functional accuracy, and error management.  
- Assign priorities based on **business criticality** and impact.
